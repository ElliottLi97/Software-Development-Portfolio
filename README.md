# Software-Development-Portfolio

Here is my attempt at creating a portfolio for my existing and future coding projects. 

I've used media querys and flex boxes to create a responsive layout that confortably fits on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

The portfolio consists of a small about me section, a section of my projects with links to them, and ways to contact me. 

The finished website can be found here [Here](https://elliottli97.github.io/Software-Development-Portfolio/)
